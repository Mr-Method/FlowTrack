Start of a netflow and snmp monitoring tool

Designed for use on a small/home network.  Testing against dd-wrt

Goal is to make this easy to install and use.  (trying to minimize any apache/database setup, we'll see how that goes)


TODO:
Database creation
perf testing
storage (may look into forking the storage processor, depends on perf)
